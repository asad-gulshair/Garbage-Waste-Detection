Garbage Detection Using CNN!
🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Garbage Detection Using CNN! 🌍

Over the past few weeks, I've been working on a deep learning project focused on garbage detection. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), I’ve developed a model capable of detecting and classifying different types of waste in real-time, which can be integrated into live video feeds for applications in waste management and recycling efforts.

Key Features:
Real-Time Detection: The model is optimized to work with live camera feeds, making it practical for on-the-go waste identification.
Custom Categories: Trained on a diverse dataset, the model can identify categories such as paper, plastic, metal, and more.
Scalable Integration: The solution is adaptable, enabling integration with existing waste management systems to enhance efficiency and sustainability.
I’m thrilled to see how this model could contribute to more effective waste management practices and support environmental sustainability initiatives.

💡 Feedback Welcome!
I'm always open to learning and improving. If you have any suggestions or see areas where this model can be enhanced, please feel free to share your thoughts!
